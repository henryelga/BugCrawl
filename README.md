# BugCrawl

### Introduction

This project replicates the behavior and interactions of bugs on a Bug Board. Bugs move according to their characteristics, and when they occupy the same cell, they engage in a battle until only one bug remains.

### Features

- **Bug Board Setup:** Initiate the simulation by loading bugs from an external file onto the board.
- **Bug Information:** Retrieve detailed data about each bug, including its ID, type, and current location.
- **Bug Search Functionality:** Efficiently locate specific bugs by their unique ID.
- **Bug Movement Control:** Activate bug movements and observe their interactions in response to taps on the board.
- **Bug Life Tracking:** Monitor the journey and status of each bug, documenting their path from beginning to end.
- **Cell Occupancy Insights:** Investigate each cell to see which bugs are present, offering insights into their spatial arrangement.
- **Ongoing Simulation:** Engage in a continuous simulation where bugs move and interact over time.
- **Bug Combat:** Observe battles between bugs as they fight for survival, shaping the dynamics of the bug population.
